What: Injury Reserve. A group I really was not put onto that much before college. When Groggs died I heard about it and I knew a few big things before then (Jailbreak The Tesla) but Injury Reserve was my first real concert ever. I saw them perform By The Time I Get To Phoenix, and I was introduced into a world of amazing live music<br><br>

Personal favorites: What a Year It's Been, Outside, Knees<br><br>

Why: In my current emotional state after finishing the semester, I have been reflecting back on everything that has happened since august 14th, and thinking to myself “what a year its been”. I really like closing out this semester thinking of and listening to one of the groups that got me into live music, and I really thoroughly enjoyed this year, through all the good and bad. In conclusion; what a year its been. Reflecting on everything has been a very unique experience to me.<br> </p>

What: One of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard, Frank Ocean. This is no hot take, as I know many who love a good cry to Blonde, or to jam out listening to Channel Orange. I have a semi-deep base in his work, I have listened to almost all of his works including endless (which I really enjoyed) but nothing hits harder than listening to frank at the right time.<br><br>

Personal favorites: Pink Matter, Seigfried<br><br>

Why: As I took all the posters down from my wall and Seigfried played, it really hit me this year was over. Almost nightly, I walked to the library listening to this song and it is stunning. As for Pink Matter, I cannot stop listening to it. I cant tell if its because of the funky beat, Andre's phenomenal verse, but I keep coming back over and over. I'm happy for the future, a bit sad the present is ending, but ready to accept the future coming to me as time moves so fast it feels like I am flying through the days.<br>

What: Ceres & Calypso in the Deep Time, super super earthy vibes that is also shoegazey/ nostalgia evoking somehow. Can really fit any mood and has one of the best album covers I have seen in a while. It definitely has been in the background as I study for my finals.<br><br>

Personal favorites: Into the Deep Time, Fell in Love, Pangea Girls<br><br>

Why: This album sounds like what it looks. It is relaxing, comforting, and is just so nice to listen to. As I mentioned last week I have really been enjoying more of this genre recently and i think this is a great album even for someone who doesnt listen to very much of this genre. As i go home (even if only for a few weeks) I plan on listening to this in the car as i think of everything that happened this year. Definitely give this a listen on a lazy summer day and relax.<br></p>
