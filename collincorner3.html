    <p>
What: Ants From Up There is almost certainly my favorite album of the year. The British six piece, Black Country New Road has put out what very well could be their magnum opus. This album is beautiful, the vocals are amazing, and the songs take me to another planet. After this album came out, Isaac, the lead singer stepped down from the band for mental health reasons. But wow, this was a great album.<br><br>

Personal favorites: Concorde, Good Will Hunting, The Place Where He Inserted the Blade<br><br>

Why: And if we're on a burnin' starship / he escape pods filled with your friends / Your childhood film photos / There's no room for me to go / Oh, I'd wait there / Float with the wreckage / Fashion a long sword / Traverse the Milky Way / Tryna get home to you / And you bring some piece of the stars.<br> I MEAN LOOK AT THAT AND TELL ME ITS NOT BEAUTIFUL. Wow. Just cant even describe it. I think I want to make a video on this topic. <br> <br>

What: Black, Hellfire, Midi. Black Midi is truly one of the most creative groups out in general. I had the privlidge of seeing them a year ago, back when they released Cavaldade and I was instantly punched in the face by the abrasive instrumentals, in your face lyrics, and all around swagger. This Summer, Hellfire released.<br><br>

Personal favorites: Sugar/Tzu, 27 Questions, Welcome to Hell <br><br>

Why: I recently got to see both Black Midi and Black Country New Road together and it was one of the best concerts of my life. Hellfire is one of the most cohesive projects I have ever heard, it sounds just like the absurd album cover, and is nothing shy of absolutely thrilling. Greep, the vocalist, is incredibly captivating, and he is backed up by Simpson on drums to give an experience like no other.<br>

What: The Glow Pt. 2. The Microphones aka Phil Elevrum. I would say this is his best work, but he has another album that is at this level as well. Maybe I will save it for another week. The Glow Pt. 2 is a beautiful yet heartbreaking folk album that is perfect for romanticizing your melancholic solitude.<br><br>

Personal favorites: I Want Wind to Blow, The Moon, Felt Your Shape<br><br>

Why: This album is timeless, it came out in 2001, but it has withstood the test of time. The vocals feel so raw, giving the album this entire feeling of authenticity. The lyrics range from happy to downright gutwrenching, as most of this is about a relationship that was unable to succeed. It is beautiful and something that is easy to get obsessed with if you arent careful.<br>
